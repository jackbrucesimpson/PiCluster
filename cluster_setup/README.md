# PiCluster Workshop

## Description
Workshop Materials for introducing researchers to running parallel code on computer clusters using the Python (via MPI4Py) and R (via Rmpi) programming languages.

A versatile visualization tool for exploring count data. This tool enables you to quickly investigate and visualise relationships within your dataset.

We'll be using the Raspberry Pi cluster we built ourselves to run the code taught in this workshop.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that participants will have a basic understanding of either Python or R - equivalent to what they would have acquired attending a Software Carpentry workshop on these topics.

## Workshop structure

The workshop consists of a introductory background talk. You can then use the materials in the Python and R directories to teach MPI using these languages.

#### Background

The `Intro.md` file introduces this workshop and the following concepts:
* Computing clusters and why they're useful
* Why we need to run code in parallel
* Parallelising code with MPI on clusters
* Using MPI in your Python and R code
* Raspberry Pi Cluster
* How we can use MPI through Python and R

#### Python

Python materials are located within the Python directory and follow the following format:

* Hello world script

#### R

R materials are located within the R directory and follow the following format:

* Hello world script

## Program Requirements

This workshop will require the following software:
* Python programming language
* [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/)
* MPI4Py (Python package)
* RMPI (R Package)

You'll also need a computer cluster set up with MPI installed on them.

## Example Dataset

The example datasets are contained within the `data` directory.
